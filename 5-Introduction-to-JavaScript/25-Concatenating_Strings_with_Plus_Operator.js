<!--Learned to concatenate Strings with Plus Operator.-->
<!--Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.-->
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
